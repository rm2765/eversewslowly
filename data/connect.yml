    <h3 style="text-align:center;">Mission</h3>
    
    The name ***Ever Sew Slowly*** adequately describes my journey in learning to sew and re-imagining & transforming clothes. It is a slow process in two important ways:
     
     * **First**, refashioning is a side hobby, not a full-time gig. There are times when I don’t have the hours or energy left in the day for sewing and my sewing machine sits quiet while life takes priority.
     * **Second**, every refashioned garment, thrift find, and handmade piece all are a stand against fast fashion and its harmful social and environmental impacts. 
    
    My dream is to make refashioning accessible to everyone—showing that with patience, creativity, and a willingness to embrace mistakes, anyone can transform their relationship with clothing into something **more mindful :turtle:, sustainable :seedling:, and personally expressive** :blossom:.

    I work with data to uncover insights by day :city_sunrise: and have fun transforming & upcycling clothes by night :night_with_stars:. 
    It may be surprising but, I had never really been interested in fashion :womans_clothes:. For years, I hated shopping for new clothes. Trying on dresses for birthday parties, graduations and other events only led to frustration as I never liked how I looked or felt. 
    Either I'd find something I **liked** that didn't quite fit, or I found something that **fit** but didn't like it at all. Pride in my uniqueness, individuality and self-expression took a toll :woman_facepalming:. 
    Altering and creating my own clothes was never something I thought I would have the ability and time to do, but made a lot of sense for it to become an outlet for me during Covid. 
    I thought *“why don’t I learn to sew and make a dress from scratch”* :sewing_needle:?
    
    And the rest is herstory.
