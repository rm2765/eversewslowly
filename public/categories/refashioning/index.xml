      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the winter season coming to an end, you may find yourself staring at a pile of old sweaters, cardigans, and other winter clothing that you no longer wear or that have seen better days.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic led to a period of uncertainty, disruption and reflection. It was a stressful time for everyone and more so for frontline workers. Many who were temporarily out of a job or for their first time working from home found themselves with more time on their hands. Trying out new things was a way to move forward and gain a sense of agency during COVID. One of those things for me was learning how to sew. (I also became very interested in birds ðŸ˜º). &lt;!---more--&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
